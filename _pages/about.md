I am a first-year PhD candidate in mathematics, working under the supervision of Fabrice Rossi and Arthur Thomas.
I am currently working on combining machine learning with noncausal econometric methods to forecast locally explosive time series.

Desperately waiting for Olympique Lyonnais to lift a title, for Pierre Sage to make a comeback, and for Cherki to win the Ballon d’Or.
